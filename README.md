## About this Project
this is a number guessing game, where you guess the value of the various ingredients to try and match the value of the potion number given by the teacher. It was developed as part of the UofT coding bootcamp. It is written in Javascript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS. This was my first major delve into JQuery.
